### Getting setup
In order to run the application, [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) need to be installed on your local machine (it is recommended to use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3).  

You then need to clone this repository locally:
```
git clone git@github.com:zollillo/message-box.git
```  

To install the necessary `npm` packages, please run the following command from within the project folder (installing the packages may take one or two minutes):
```
npm install
```  

Once the installation process has finished, you can run the application with:
```
npm start
```  

The app then runs in _development mode_ and is accessible in your browser at  http://localhost:3000/.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
